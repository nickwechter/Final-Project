## Project Evolution and Final Thoughts:

My intended audience for this presentation was meant to encompass all NBA fans, ranging from casual, occasional, viewers to hardcore, watch-at-least-one-game-a-night, viewers. I think I did a good job of tailoring the material to appeal to the entire spectrum of fans, but the content most specifically targets the middle-ground of fans. I decided to shy away from going too deep into the statistics, as I thought that would be alienating; even the use of some advanced statistics (such as “usage”) may intimidate more casual viewers. I think that the visualizations that I chose were an appropriate middle ground. The comparative nature of the visualizations highlighted Luka’s status of being a statistically “special” basketball player, even if the actual variables may have been a bit confusing to a more casual NBA fan. On the other side, I think that fans with an intermediate statistically literacy, and a greater understanding of the players I was comparing Luka to, can spend more time on the visualizations and garner insight that goes deeper than “just the numbers.”

While the theme of my presentation stayed consistent, the interviews I performed for part two helped me understand that I could not simply draw a straightforward narrative of Luka’s pre-destined path to being an all-time-great NBA player. All of my recorded interviews, and more conversations I had with NBA-fan friends over the course of the previous weeks, indicated that “greatness” went much deeper than something that could be caught on a graph. To them, historical greatness was more aligned with a mythos of athletic prowess as opposed to an accomplishment. These interviews motivated me to draw three explicit examples of athletes that achieved historic greatness in different ways. The interviews especially helped me realize that pairing data with an image may be the most effective way to communicates the tacit concept of greatness to a viewer (I am thinking specifically of the images of Allen Iverson stepping over Ty Lue, and Steph Curry shooting from 35+ feet away from the hoop). 

I also decided to tone back on my assertion of Luka being an all-time great. I decided to tone this section back because 1. The data was too hard to wrangle to make comprehensive visualizations, and 2. No matter how comprehensive the visualizations were, establishing a player as an all-time great is a hard task to achieve. Instead, I wanted to establish a sense of possibility around Luka Doncic. I attempted to do this by 1. Establishing him as well-beyond the ability of his draft class (radar charts), and 2. Associating him with some of the greatest names in basketball through comparing rookie and second-year statistics (radar charts). 

The radar charts were an important visualization tool for me, because they were the best option for a holistic representation of what a player can do to contribute to their team through the course of a game. A huge problem with the radar charts was that the variables I wanted to visualize all had different ranges; some were percentages (3P%), other values would range from 0-10 (TRB, AST), and others would range from 15-35 (PTS, FGA). I overcame this problem by establishing a category leader to assign 100% value, and recorded all other fields as a percentage of that categories maximum value. I liked this solution because I think it aided the viewers overall ability to compare the different players included in the radar charts visualization.
